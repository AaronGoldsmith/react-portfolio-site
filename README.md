# react-portfolio-site
A separate repository specifically for git version control of my portfolio site

### Built in React
In order to use a **React App** for my GitHub Pages site, I would be unable to utilize react-router because it would interfere with other repositories deployed on GH Pages. In order to deploy correctly, I had to reconfigure how the site renders new components, by keeping everything on a single page and rendering based on state.
